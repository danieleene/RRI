Run Run Impostor repo

This beautiful journey which made learn,experience and think has not come to his end.
I am glad for Submitting my First Project 
The Run Run Impostor game !
These 4 months have been with ups and downs (maybe more properly I should admit 'these 3 months' which is the effective time I was dedicating to it)

However I proudly can tell that I learnt from almost each day a lesson : 
there were days of thinking and ordering ideas , there were days of Coding and implementing(C#), again there were days which I dedicated to the design, but
also unproductive days... and finally these last were testing days .
Only at the end I've really tested on a Mobile Device , yes .

With honesty I admit , however I am glad for this opportunity handled to me .
It was a new Experience.
The Run Run Impostor 2D  is an exciting game and for some aspects also kinda crazy (the last path part at the end of World 5 is just an example of it)
Player never knows which pitfalls are next , thanks to her/his  courage (and patience) she/ he will arrive at the end eventually ... descharging energies and emotions in a last
long final run .

This is not my last run because there is not an "arrival point".
Life is a journey.
